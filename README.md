# Traffic_Sign_Recog_Inter_IIT

# PS in nutshell:
* Use GTSRB dataset for simple Traffic Signal Recognition
* Add 5 classes
* Increase Dataset Complexity using augmentations and transformations.
* While using UI the user should have control over images or any changes done to them.
* Also train, test split can be done in UI.
* Evaluate trained model in new data.
* Connect classfier to UI and propose useful feedbacks for users.
